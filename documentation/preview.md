# Here are the rules governing previewing card:

You can preview cards. There are two kinds of previewing. As far as I
know, the difference is not explained anyone yet.

## Normal previewing
The first kind of previewing allow you to see the result of applying a
template to a cards. This is what you obtain when you click on the
button ```Cards...``` if you are viewing a card already created (i.e. in
the browser or in the Edit window). It is also what you obtain when
you click on preview in the browser, and when you actually review a
card.

## Filled previewing
When you click on the button ```Cards...``` from the Add window, ord
from the Note Type manager, you enter this mode. In this mode, every
fields are filled. Either by the actual content of the card you are
created, or by the name of the field parenthesis.

It means that you can not test the result when some fields are missing
using this window, because the content of ```{{^foo}}...{{#foo}}```
will never be displayed.
