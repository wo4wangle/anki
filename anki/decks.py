"""This module deals with decks and their configurations.


A deck is an array composed of:
newToday -- two number array. 
            First one is currently unused
            The second one is equal to the negation (* (-1)) of the increase of the number of new cards to see today.
revToday -- two number array. 
            First one is currently unused
            The second one is equal to the negation (* (-1)) of the increase of the number of review cards to see today.
lrnToday -- two number array used somehow for custom study, Seems to be unused in the current code.
timeToday -- two number array used somehow for custom study,  seems to be currently unused
conf -- (string) id of option group from dconf
usn -- Update sequence number: used in same way as other usn vales in db
desc -- deck description, it is shown when cards are learned or reviewd
dyn -- 1 if dynamic (AKA filtered) deck, 
collapsed -- true when deck is collapsed, 
extendNew -- extended new card limit (for custom study), 
extendRev -- extended review card limit (for custom study), 
name -- name of deck, 
browserCollapsed -- true when deck collapsed in browser, 
id -- deck ID (automatically generated long), 
mod -- last modification time, 
mid -- the model of the deck
"""



"""A configuration of deck is a dictionnary composed of:
name -- its name, including the parents, and the "::"
new -- The configuration for new cards, see below.
lapse -- The configuration for lapse cards, see below.
rev -- The configuration for review cards, see below.
maxTaken -- The number of seconds after which to stop the timer
timer -- whether timer should be shown (1) or not (0)
autoplay -- whether the audio associated to a question should be
played when the question is shown
replayq -- whether the audio associated to a question should be
played when the answer is shown
mod -- Last modification time
usn -- see USN documentation
dyn -- Whether this deck is dynamic. Not present in the default configurations
id -- configuration ID (automatically generated long). Not present in the default configurations.

The configuration related to new card is composed of:
delays -- The list of successive delay between the learning steps of
the new cards, as explained in the manual.
ints -- The delays according to the button pressed while leaving the
learning mode.
initial factor -- The initial ease factor
separate -- delay between answering Good on a card with no steps left, and seeing the card again. Seems to be unused in the code
order -- In which order new cards must be shown. NEW_CARDS_RANDOM = 0
and NEW_CARDS_DUE = 1
perDay -- Maximal number of new cards shown per day
bury -- Whether to bury cards related to new cards answered

The configuration related to lapses card is composed of:
delays -- The delays between each relearning while the card is lapsed,
as in the manual
mult -- percent by which to multiply the current interval when a card
goes has lapsed
minInt -- a lower limit to the new interval after a leech
leechFails -- the number of lapses authorized before doing leechAction
leechAction -- What to do to leech cards. 0 for suspend, 1 for
mark. Numbers according to the order in which the choices appear in
aqt/dconf.ui


The configuration related to review card is composed of:
perDay -- Numbers of cards to review per day
ease4 -- the number to add to the easyness when the easy button is
pressed
fuzz -- The new interval is multiplied by a random number between
-fuzz and fuzz
minSpace -- not currently used
ivlFct -- multiplication factor applied to the intervals Anki
generates
maxIvl -- the maximal interval for review
bury -- If True, when a review card is answered, the related cards of
its notes are buried
